## Rule details

After chasing some performance issues the spread operator was found to be
particularly slow. Additionally, when the engineers went to rework that code,
the use of the spread operator made the code very hard to understand and track,
due to the implicit passing of variables.

With a performance and a DX reason against it, we've decided to call the spread
operator an anti-pattern for our codebase.
