## [2.0.0] - July 9 2018

### BREAKING

- Dropped checking actual `const` (by ES2015 syntax) constants in `no-const-reassign`. Now only focuses on const-named variables. Use ESLint's `no-const-assign` rule for `const`.

## [1.2.2] - Apr 19 2018

### Fixed

- Fixed a no-dead-code bug where the email address was not correctly reported.

## [1.2.1] - Apr 19 2018

OMG typing...

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `no-dead-code` was matching on `@replaceby` instead of `@removeby`

## [1.2.0] - Apr 19 2018

### Added

- CHANGELOG.md
- `no-dead-code` rule now accepts `annotation` option to allow renaming the triggering annotation.

### Changed

- `no-dead-code` now prefers `@removeby` following community feedback. Not a breaking change as `@deathdate` still works, but all docs have been updated to reflect the new preference.

### Deprecated

- `no-dead-code` users should switch from `@deathdate` to `@removeby` annotations, or update their rule options to explicitly use `@deathdate`, which will be removed as a usable default in 2.x.x.

## [1.1.1] - Apr 18 2018

### Fixed

- Bug in `no-dead-code` rule not accepting default options.

## [1.1.0] - Apr 18 2018

Configurable `no-dead-code`.

### Added

- `no-dead-code` rule now accepts `currentEpochTimeMS` option
- `no-dead-code` rule now accepts `daysBeforeDeathToReport` option
